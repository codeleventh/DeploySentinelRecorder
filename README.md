# DeploySentinel Recorder fork

Just a fork of
[Deploy Sentinel recorder](https://github.com/DeploySentinel/Recorder) for my
needs

- Puppeteer framework as default and the single one
- Script strings that generated by this add-on compatible with specific
  Puppeteer version (8.0.0)
- No comments in the recorded scripts
- Scripts are truncated at beginning and end
